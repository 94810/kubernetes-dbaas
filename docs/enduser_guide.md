# End-user guide

## Prerequisites

- You have your Operator ready and deployed.  [See the system administrator guide.](sysadmin_guide.md)

## Steps

1. Create a custom resource configuration, e.g. "mycrd.yaml"

Here's an example;

```
apiVersion: dbaas.bedag.ch/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesDbaas
metadata:
  name: kubernetesdbaas-sample  
spec:
  provisioner: sqlserver
  endpoint: us-sqlserver-test
```

- "provisioner" tells the Operator which driver to use
- "endpoint" tells the Operator where to create the operator. Your endpoint names are configured in the Operator 
configuration and should be properly documented inside of your organization.

2. Apply the configuration in your cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f mycrd.yaml
```

To delete the configuration:

```
kubectl delete -f mycrd.yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

In case your DB wasn't created successfully, the Operator will write some information in the resource status field.

```
kubectl get kubernetesdbaas kubernetesdbaas-sample -o yaml
```

- `LastError`: tells you what's the last error generated by the Operator. If not nil, the resource is in an error state.
- `LastErrorUpdateCount`: specifies how many times LastError was updated. At the moment, the operation generating error will be retried 14 times with a pause of 3 seconds between retries (subject to change in future releases).
- `LastUpdate`: tells you when was the last time (Unix time format) LastError was updated.
- `Unrecoverable`: if set to true, the Operator was unable to fix the error itself and manual intervention is required. No additional retries will be carried out for this resource.
