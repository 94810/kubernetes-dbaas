## Description

The **Kubernetes Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) Operator** ("the Operator") is a [Kubernetes
Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) used
to provision database instances in database management systems:

- The Operator can be easily configured and installed in a Kubernetes cluster
  using the provided Helm Chart.
- End-users such as software developers are able to create new database
  instances by writing simple Database custom resources. 
- Operations on DBMS are implemented using stored procedures called by the
  Operator whenever necessary, allowing you to define your own custom logic.   
- Credentials to access provisioned database instances are saved into Kubernetes
  Secrets.

## Why?

### In brief
There are cases where an organization cannot or does not want to host their critical
data in cloud or distributed environments, and searches for a way to bridge the
gap between their Kubernetes clusters and Database Management System (DBMS)
solutions. Medium to large organizations are often composed by distinct
professional figures such as software developers, system administrators and
database administrators, each with its own need: 

- **Software developers** (end-users) would like to have their DB instances
  provisioned as soon as possible using a user-friendly interface. 
- **System administrators** (sysadmins) would like to have a flexible, declarative 
  solution that is well-integrated in the Kubernetes ecosystem. 
- **Database administrators** (DBAs) must retain control over the core business
  logic behind database provisioning as much as possible while still automating
  the process in order to save time. 
 
### Kubernetes operators 
This is where an on-premise Database-as-a-Service can help to satisfy those
needs. Kubernetes offers an innovative way to extend it by creating a
Kubernetes operator. An operator is a specific pattern used to handle the life
cycle of Kubernetes resources. Its goal is to capture the human natural way of
performing tasks in order to automate processes that would otherwise be
carried out manually. Due to the infinite number of possibilities when
deploying and administering an application, Kubernetes can be extended using
the operator pattern with the intention of encapsulating complex business
logic, such as interacting with external services and performing a serie of
tasks.

### Goals
One of the Operator's strongest goals is having a clear **separation of
concerns** between end-users, sysadmins and DBAs: DBAs can retain full control
on the life cycle of database instances by creating stored procedures or an
equivalent mechanism for each operation. This decouples the configuration from
the implementation and ensures a well-defined boundary between the Kubernetes
and database worlds. **Companies with strict compliance requirements can configure
an opaque provisioning system for databases where data and business logic is
kept as close as possible to their location** without having to resort to a
managed service; the only requirement is a formal specification under form of
Kubernetes resources between the system and database infrastructures which
provide the Operator with the minimal amount of information needed to
communicate with each supported DBMS.

The Operator can be used with database management systems hosted both inside and
outside a Kubernetes cluster transparently.

## Concepts

### Custom resources

The Operator brings **3 new custom resources** into the cluster:

- `Database` resources are used to describe Database instances.  
- `DatabaseClass` resources describe the format of the operations to be executed
  on DB systems, what driver should be used to call operations and how data
  should be saved into `Secrets`.
- `OperatorConfig` is like a specialized `ConfigMap` used to configure the
  Operator depending on the needs of the user organization. It contains also the
  list of DBMS endpoints, including their DSN, bindings them to a particular
  `DatabaseClass`.

### Operations

There are currently **3 operations** supported by the Operator:

- Database creation
- Database deletion
- Database credential rotation

The [control loop](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller) of the Operator can be summarized by
means of the following flowchart:

### An example

The following diagram shows what happens when an operation is executed on
a `Database` resource:

![System diagram](/img/diagrams/01_system_diagram.png)

1. The Operator watches the cluster for a new event generated by a Database
   resource, i.e. creation, deletion or credential rotation.
2. The Operator calls the relative stored procedure or equivalent mechanism on
   the DBMS.
3. The DBMS executes the stored procedure according to the implementation of
   the database administrator.
4. Finally, the Operator acts on the Secret by creating, deleting or updating it
   with the data returned by the operation.
